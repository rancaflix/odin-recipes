        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>For those who want something similar to lasagna, but are vegan or just want more variety by not having meat on their plate, this dish uses the
            underutilized eggplant as a lighter option.</p>
        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>4 medium to large eggplants</li>
                <li>Flour</li>
                <li>4 Eggs</li>
                <li>Breadcrumbs</li>
                <li>Slices of mozarella cheese, around 400 grams</li>
                <li>Parmesan cheese</li>
                <li>Tomato sauce</li>
                <li>Frying oil</li>
            </ul>
        <h2>Steps</h2>
            <ol>
                <li>The night before, or 3 hours before the rest of the preparation: Slice the eggplants vertically with some width, creating around 20 slices.
                    Stack them onto a bowl with drainage, like a salad spinner, or a strainer on top of another bowl. Stack the slices with salt and paper towels
                    between them, and put a weight on top of them, like another bowl with water. This in order to get out most of the water of the eggplant.
                </li>
                <li>In a frying pan, put enough frying oil to submerge the slices, like half the height of the pan. While it heats, put three bowls next to your pan,
                    and put on them, flour, eggwash (break 3-4 eggs inside the bowl and make a homogenous mix), and breadcrumbs.
                </li>
                <li>Once your oil is hot enough, take your eggplants slices and coat them in the bowls: first flour, then eggwash, and lastly, breadcrumbs.
                    After this, you can put it in the pan. Fry until golden-brown.
                </li>
                <li>Start preheating your oven to medium-high heat. Once you have 5 slices taken out and a bit cool down, start making the dish. In the bowl that
                    you will put in the oven, start with tomato sauce, then lay the slices. The slices should cover all the surface of the bowl, or even less, it's better
                    if it is packed. After this layer, put slices of mozarella cheese on top of the eggplant slices, then cover with a thin layer of tomato sauce,
                    and then spread some parmesan cheese.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Repeat this with the next two layers: Eggplant, mozarella cheese, tomato sauce, and then parmesan cheese. On the last layer, after the eggplant,
                    pour tomato sauce, then the mozarella and parmesan cheeses. After this, the dish goes to the oven for 30-40 minutes.
                </li>
                <li>Enjoy!</li>
