        <p>These are the ingredients you'll need to make this top-rated homemade lasagna recipe: </p>
            <ul>
                <li>Meat: This lasagna recipe starts with a pound of ground meat (½ pound ground pork, ½ pound lean ground beef). </li>
                <li>Onion: A diced onion is cooked until translucent with the ground meat.</li> 
                <li>Canned tomatoes: You'll need a can of tomato sauce and a can of crushed tomatoes.</li> 
                <li>Fresh herbs: For fresh flavor, chop two tablespoons of parsley and crush one clove of garlic.</li> 
                <li>Sugar: A dash of sugar balances out all of the acidity from the tomatoes.</li> 
                <li>Spices and seasonings: This homemade lasagna is seasoned with dried basil, dried oregano, salt, and black pepper.</li> 
                <li>Noodles: Of course, you'll need lasagna noodles! This recipe calls for uncooked noodles, but you can use the oven-ready variety to save time.</li> 
                <li>Cheese: The cheese layer is made up of cottage cheese and Parmesan. You'll also need shredded mozzarella.</li> 
                <li>Eggs: Eggs make the cheese layer extra creamy. Plus, they act as a binding agent (which means they hold the layer together). </li>

                <li>1 (16 ounce) package lasagna noodles</li>
                <li>1 pound small-curd cottage cheese</li>
                <li>3/4 cup grated parmesan cheese</li>
                <li>3 large eggs</li>
                <li>2 teaspoons salt</li>
                <li>1/4 teaspoon ground black pepper</li>
                <li>1 (16 ounce) package shredded mozzarella cheese</li>
            </ul>
        <h2>Steps</h2>
            <ol>
                <li>Combine pork and ground beef in a large, deep skillet over medium-high heat; cook and stir until browned and crumbly, 5 to 7 minutes. Add onion and cook until translucent, about 5 minutes.</li>
                <li>Stir in crushed tomatoes, tomato sauce, 1 tablespoon fresh parsley, garlic, basil, salt, oregano, and sugar. Reduce heat to medium-low and simmer, stirring occasionally, for 30 minutes.</li>
                <li>While the sauce is simmering, bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a boil. Cook lasagna noodles in the boiling water, stirring occasionally, until tender yet firm to the bite, 8 to 10 minutes. Drain and set aside.</li>
                <li>While the noodles are cooking, preheat the oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C).</li>
                <li>Mix cottage cheese, Parmesan cheese, eggs, remaining 1 tablespoon fresh parsley, salt, and pepper in a large bowl until combined.</li>
                <li>Assemble lasagna: Spread a spoon or two of sauce over the bottom of a 9x13-inch baking dish just to to coat it. Place two layers of noodles over the sauce to cover. Layer with 1/2 of the cheese mixture, 1/2 of the remaining sauce, and 1/2 of the mozzarella cheese. Repeat layers once more using the remaining noodles, cheese mixture, sauce, and mozzarella. Cover the baking dish with aluminum foil.</li>
                <li>Bake in the preheated oven for 30 to 40 minutes. Remove the foil and bake until cheese is golden brown, 5 to 10 more minutes.</li>
                <li>Remove from the oven and let stand for 10 minutes before cutting and serving.</li>
                <li>Enjoy!</li>
